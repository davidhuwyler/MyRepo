Module "LED1"      (component LED)
   - LED1_Init -Performs the LED driver initialization.
   - LED1_Deinit -Deinitializes the driver
   - LED1_On -This turns the LED on.
   - LED1_Off -This turns the LED off.
   - LED1_Neg -This negates/toggles the LED
   - LED1_Get -This returns logical 1 in case the LED is on, 0 otherwise.
   - LED1_Put -Turns the LED on or off.
   - LED1_SetRatio16 -Method to specify the duty cycle. If using a PWM pin, this means the duty cycle is set. For On/off pins, 
                values smaller 0x7FFF means off, while values greater means on.

Module "LED2"      (component LED)
   - LED2_Init -Performs the LED driver initialization.
   - LED2_Deinit -Deinitializes the driver
   - LED2_On -This turns the LED on.
   - LED2_Off -This turns the LED off.
   - LED2_Neg -This negates/toggles the LED
   - LED2_Get -This returns logical 1 in case the LED is on, 0 otherwise.
   - LED2_Put -Turns the LED on or off.
   - LED2_SetRatio16 -Method to specify the duty cycle. If using a PWM pin, this means the duty cycle is set. For On/off pins, 
                values smaller 0x7FFF means off, while values greater means on.

Module "WAIT1"     (component Wait)
   - WAIT1_Wait10Cycles -Wait for 10 CPU cycles.
   - WAIT1_Wait100Cycles -Wait for 100 CPU cycles.
   - WAIT1_WaitCycles -Wait for a specified number of CPU cycles (16bit data type).
   - WAIT1_WaitLongCycles -Wait for a specified number of CPU cycles (32bit data type).
   - WAIT1_Waitms -Wait for a specified time in milliseconds.
   - WAIT1_Waitus -Wait for a specified time in microseconds.
   - WAIT1_Waitns -Wait for a specified time in nano seconds.
   - WAIT1_WaitOSms -If an RTOS is enabled, this routine will use a non-blocking wait method. Otherwise it will do a 
                busy/blocking wait.

Module "SegLCD1"   (component SegLCD_LDD)
   - SegLCD1_Init -Initializes the device. Allocates memory for the device data structure, allocates interrupt vectors and sets 
                interrupt priority, sets pin routing, sets timing, etc.   If the "Enable in init. code" is set to "yes" value 
                then the device is also enabled(see the description of the Enable() method). In this case the Enable() method 
                is not necessary and needn't to be generated.    This method can be called only once. Before the second call of 
                Init() the Deinit() must be called first.
   - SegLCD1_Deinit -Deinitializes the device. Switches off the device, frees the device data structure memory, interrupts 
                vectors, etc.
   - SegLCD1_GetEventStatus -Gets current pending flags and clears them. This method is available if the interrupt service 
                property is disabled. This method must be called in polling mode, when is called method StartFaultDetectFrame.
   - SegLCD1_SetFrontplaneData -Set data to the LCD frontplane data registers. It sets/clears all used segments.
   - SegLCD1_GetFrontplaneData -Get data from the LCD frontplane data registers.
   - SegLCD1_SetBlinking -Activates/deactivates blinking of all segments (according to parameter BlinkMode).
   - SegLCD1_SetBlank -This method sets the blank display without affecting state of each segment. If supported by the LCD 
                module, the method allows alternate display setting. A segment state is set by method SetFrontplaneData or 
                SetAlternateFrontplaneData.

Module "SW1"       (component BitIO)
   - SW1_GetVal -Returns the input/output value. If the direction is [input] then the input value of the pin is read and 
                returned. If the direction is [output] then the last written value is returned (see <Safe mode> property for 
                limitations). This method cannot be disabled if direction is [input].

Module "SW2"       (component BitIO)
   - SW2_GetVal -Returns the input/output value. If the direction is [input] then the input value of the pin is read and 
                returned. If the direction is [output] then the last written value is returned (see <Safe mode> property for 
                limitations). This method cannot be disabled if direction is [input].

Module "CS1"       (component CriticalSection)
   - CS1_CriticalVariable -Defines a variable if necessary. This is a macro.
   - CS1_EnterCritical -Enters a critical section
   - CS1_ExitCritical -Exits a critical section

Module "TI1"       (component TimerInt)

Module "TU1"       (component TimerUnit_LDD)
   - TU1_Init -Initializes the device. Allocates memory for the device data structure, allocates interrupt vectors and sets 
                interrupt priority, sets pin routing, sets timing, etc. If the property <"Enable in init. code"> is set to 
                "yes" value then the device is also enabled (see the description of the <Enable> method). In this case the 
                <Enable> method is not necessary and needn't to be generated. This method can be called only once. Before the 
                second call of Init the <Deinit> must be called first.
   - TU1_SetEventMask -Enables/disables event(s). The events contained within the mask are enabled. Events not contained within 
                the mask are disabled. The component event masks are defined in the PE_Types.h file. Note: Event that are not 
                generated (See the "Events" tab in the Component inspector) are not handled by this method. In this case the 
                method returns ERR_PARAM_MASK error code. See also method <GetEventMask>.
   - TU1_GetEventMask -Returns current events mask. Note: Event that are not generated (See the "Events" tab in the Component 
                inspector) are not handled by this method. See also method <SetEventMask>.
   - TU1_GetCounterValue -Returns the content of counter register. This method can be used both if counter is enabled and if 
                counter is disabled. The method is not available if HW doesn't allow reading of the counter.
   - TU1_SetOffsetTicks -Sets the new offset value to channel specified by the parameter ChannelIdx. It is user responsibility 
                to use value below selected period. This method is available when at least one channel is configured.
   - TU1_GetOffsetTicks -Returns the number of counter ticks to compare match channel specified by the parameter ChannelIdx. 
                See also method <SetOffsetTicks>. This method is available when at least one channel is configured.

Module "PTC"       (component Init_GPIO_VAR0)
   - PTC_Init -This method initializes registers of the GPIO module according to the Peripheral Initialization settings. Call 
                this method in user code to initialize the module. By default, the method is called by PE automatically; see 
                "Call Init method" property of the component for more details.

Module "Cpu"       (component MKL46Z256MC4)
